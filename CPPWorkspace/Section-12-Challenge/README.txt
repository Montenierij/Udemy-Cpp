This section goes over Pointers and References. One of the larger topics,
this section explains what each of these items is and how to use them as
well as their implication in Memory Allocation. Along with explaining their
benefits, the section also explains Pointer's relationship to Array names
as well as some of the potential pitfalls of pointers. To wrap up, the section
begins discussion on L-values and R-Values.
