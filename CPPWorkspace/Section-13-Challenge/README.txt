This section goes over the one of the main ideas of C++: Object Oriented Programming
(OOP.) OOP, and specifically Classes and Objects are explained at the beginning. After
learning about the power of OOP, we learn how to build these Classes and their objects
by going over topics such as public/private, constructors, destructors, defaults, overloading, 
and more. The section also describes in-depth concepts such as Shallow/Deep copying, 'this' pointers,
Friends of classes, and structures vs classes before giving the section challenge.
